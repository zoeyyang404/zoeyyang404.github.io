Hi, I’m Ziyang Yang. I’m currently a data scientist working at an IoT company, focusing on time series forecasting and anomaly detection. In 2025, I obtained my PhD from Lancaster University, supervised by Prof. Idris Eckley and Prof. Paul Fearnhead, and sponsored by BT. My research focused on developing novel anomaly detection algorithms for monitoring large-scale IoT networks efficiently and accurately in real time.

### Why I built this site
In the era of large language models, writing blogs and scientific notes can feel a bit pointless — but paradoxically, LLMs have made *precision, understanding, and original thinking* even more important. Being able to clearly explain ideas, evaluate claims, and connect concepts matters more than ever.

I’ve benefited a lot from reading thoughtful technical blogs (for example, Gregory Gundersen’s site), and I genuinely enjoy writing for a broad audience. I’ve written before during my PhD (see my old site), and I want to continue doing that here — learning new things and explaining them from the perspective of a statistician working in industry.

On this site, I share:
- Research notes and paper summaries (especially on classic and foundational work — yes, even the “old but solid” stuff like *Attention Is All You Need*)  
- Technical tutorials and experiments  
- Project logs and implementation details  
- Occasionally, thoughts on my career and learning journey  

This is not meant to be a polished portfolio, but a living notebook.

### In case you are curious about my PhD research
My PhD focused on developing real-time anomaly detection (also known as changepoint detection) algorithms for monitoring large-scale IoT sensor data and multivariate time series. I also collaborated with startups on computer vision projects, using black-box deep learning models for image classification and segmentation.

My interests include:
- Time series forecasting  
- Changepoint detection  
- Diffusion models  
- And, of course, new AI methods in general  

My partner works on computer vision, which I jokingly see as “fine-tuning black boxes” — but even as a statistics PhD, I have to admit that modern models do have some very elegant ideas, especially around representation learning and transformers.

Some highlights of my PhD:
- My favourite paper is currently under submission, but you can already read it in my thesis:  
  *“Bagel: A Fast Bayesian Changepoint Detection Algorithm for Detecting Mean and Slope Changes with Seasonality.”*  
- Two other published papers focus on practical methods for efficient real-time monitoring of multivariate data streams.  
- Our work was awarded runner-up in the TakeAim 2024 competition.

### In case you are curious about my experience
- I did my undergraduate degree at Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, where two lecturers first sparked my interest in statistics.  
- After graduating, I applied for MSc programmes at Warwick, Imperial, Edinburgh, Manchester, and UCL — all rejected (lol). A friend later told me: *“Education is not about where you are, but how eager you are to learn.”* I applied to Southampton and got in.  
- I completed my MSc at Southampton, where I had great lecturers, good weather, and excellent student support. My dissertation supervisor Jessie encouraged me a lot and played a big role in pushing me towards a PhD.  
- I only applied to STOR-i and got in. I love STOR-i. Even though I was lonely at the beginning — coming from a different culture and language, especially during the pandemic — everyone there was incredibly kind and inclusive, which made my PhD experience much easier and more enjoyable.  
- I was supervised by Idris and Paul — a great combination. I still hope one day I’ll have Idris’s interpersonal skills and Paul’s brain. I learned not only technical skills from them, but also how to think more clearly and independently.  
- After finishing my PhD, I moved into industry. I’m now based in Edinburgh (feel free to reach out for a coffee chat), working as a data scientist at an IoT company.
