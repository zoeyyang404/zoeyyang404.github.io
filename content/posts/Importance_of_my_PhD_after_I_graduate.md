## Today, Five Months After Graduation
Today marks the fifth month since I started working as a data scientist at an IoT company after finishing my PhD.
I want to use this post to reflect on how my view of my PhD, and careers has changed since entering industry.
## During the PhD: Optimization Without Perspective
My PhD research focused on anomaly detection in the Internet of Things.

At first glance, this sounds very similar to what I am doing now, so one might expect a smooth transition.
But during the PhD, my thinking was confined to a narrow optimization loop.

I talked endlessly about communication constraints, low computational cost, and fast inference. My daily concerns were improving metrics, reducing theoretical time complexity, and minimizing storage requirements. Everything was framed as an optimization problem.
But I never truly understood what cost or fast meant to a real company.

At that time, I was honestly a bit jealous of PhD students doing highly theoretical research. Their work looked mathematically elegant, abstract, and cool. In contrast, my own research felt pragmatic, approximate, and not very mathematically attractive.
Among all my projects, my fav was the third one: a real-time Bayesian changepoint detection algorithm that I named Bagel. 
It involved Bayesian stats, and ideas that felt intellectually satisfying. It felt like I was finally “doing real research.”
By comparison, I disliked my first and second projects. They felt simple, approximate, and incremental, focused on making things work under real application considerations rather than creating something fundamentally new.

At the time, I saw that as a weakness.

## After Graduation: When Context Finally Appeared

Recently, I changed my mind.
After stepping out of academia, and letting go of the ego-driven need to always chase novelty, I finally stood on the ground. From there, the picture looked very different.
I realized that the core difference between academia and industry is not intelligence, but constraints.

What industry wants is not fancy, perfect, or theoretically beautiful solutions.
It wants systems that are simple, reliable, cheap, and fast to deploy, and then iterated upon.

Here, simple, cheap, and fast are no longer theoretical Big-O terms.
They translate directly into money, engineering effort, and infrastructure cost within a real system architecture.

During my PhD, I thought developing new approaches seemed inherently valuable, and often paid close attention to AI because they felt advanced and exciting.
However, in practice, many of the problems I now face can be solved effectively with existing statistical models, simply because they are sufficient and can be delivered quickly.

Ironically, the projects I think it is not cool enough prepared me the best for this reality.

In industry, creativity is not about inventing the most elegant model. It is about delivering a workable and dependable solution under time pressure, data imperfections, and real operational constraints.

Seen from this perspective, my PhD was never about elegance. It was about learning how to make imperfect systems work in imperfect conditions.
